## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Build the project:**
    First, build the application for production. This command bundles the React app and prepares the Cloudflare Worker.
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Run the deploy command using the Wrangler CLI. Make sure you have authenticated with Wrangler first (`wrangler login`).
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages for automatic CI/CD deployments on every push to your main branch.
